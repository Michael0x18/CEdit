CEdit - version 2.0
===================
CEdit2 is a next generation text editor for the eZ80 series of TI calculators, including the TI 84 plus CE and TI 83 premium CE calculators.
It's based on the original CEdit core, but with parts written in assembly for speed, size, and effiency.
Features:
 - Edit any file, up to 64Kb in size. This is done by using 4bpp, saving 76800 bytes of vram to hold the file and other buffers.
 - Type in lowercase or uppercase using held (instead of pressed) modifier keys
 - Type any character
 - Syntax highlighting for C and Python (Maybe)
 - Find and/or replace, including with regexes
 - Configure colors - up to 1665 different colors!
 - Configure fonts - different sizes and families allowed
 - No special file type - edit anything.
 - Ease of use
 - Modular and extensible interfaces
 - Column major mode - get rid of that pesky diagonal screen tearing caused by row major
 - and more!

CEdit2 is currently in development.
It is built with the x4 4bpp graphics engine.
