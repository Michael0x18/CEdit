# CEdit2
TI 84 plus CE text editor - VERSION 2 EXTREMELY UNSTABLE

This is the development branch of CEdit. The editor core is currently undergoing a complete rewrite, and alternative avenues for drawing and rendering are being explored. This means that this version is prone to **sweeping API changes that can and will crash your calculator**. It is in an **unstable state** and likely will not be stable for several months.

**DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH. DO STUFF FROM MASTER. THIS ONE IS JUST FOR EXPERIMENTATION. IN FACT, IT CURRENTLY DOESN'T WORK AS AN EDITOR. IT'S JUST A 4BPP COLUMN-MAJOR DEMO RIGHT NOW. DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THE PROGRAM'S ON CALC NAME BEING CEDIT. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MAKEFILE HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED ON THIS BRANCH. DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH. EVER. ONCE CHANGES ARE STABLE, THEY WILL BE PUT IN MASTER. DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH. IT CAN AND WILL CAUSE CRASHES.**

**You have been warned.**
